Wrappers for interacting with the Concordium node.

# ConcordiumNodeClient

The ConcordiumNodeClient defines the interface to be used to send and receive data from
a concordium-node.

## Creating a client
The current node setup only allows for insecure connections, which can be set up in the following way.
The access is controlled by the credentials and the metadata.
```js
import { credentials, Metadata } from "@grpc/grpc-js";
import ConcordiumNodeClient from "@concordium/concordium-node-sdk-js";

const metadata = new Metadata();
metadata.add("authentication", "rpcadmin");

const credentials = credentials.createInsecure();

const client = new ConcordiumNodeClient(
    "127.0.0.1",    // ip address
    10000,          // port
    credentials,
    metadata,
    15000           // timeout in ms
);
```

## getBlockInfo
Retrieves information about a specific block.
```js
const blockHash = "7f7409679e53875567e2ae812c9fcefe90ced8761d08554756f42bf268a42749";
const blockInfo: BlockInfo = await client.getBlockInfo(blockHash);
const transactionsCount = blockInfo.transactionCount;
...
```

## getBlocksAtHeight
Retrieves the hashes of blocks at a specific height.
```js
const blockHeight: bigint = 5310n;
const blocksAtHeight: string[] = await client.getBlocksAtHeight(blockHeight);
```

## getConsensusStatus
Retrieves the current consensus status from the node.
```js
const consensusStatus: ConsensusStatus = await client.getConsensusStatus();
const bestBlock = consensusStatus.bestBlock;
...
```

# Build

## Updating the gRPC files
If the external dependency concordium-grpc-api has been updated, then it is required to regenerate the
files from the `.proto` file. Do this by running:
```
yarn generate
```
This will overwrite the existing files in `src/grpc`. Remember to check that existing functionality still
works after performing an update.

# Test
An automatic test suite is part of this project, and it is run by executing:
```
yarn test
```
Note that the tests require a locally running concordium-node on the testnet. Otherwise the tests will fail.
