# Changelog

## 0.2.0

### Added

- Support deserializing version 2 schemas.
- Support serializing parameters for contracts using version 2 schemas.
- Support for deploying versioned smart contract modules, which is the format used in cargo-concordium v2+. (This is done by not supplying the version field in the payload)

### Breaking changes

- `serializeInitContractParameters` and `serializeUpdateContractParameters` each have an additional parameter, which denotes the version of the schema provided. For existing users that are using V0 contracts, that parameter should be `SchemaVersion.V1`.
- Deserialization of schemas have been changed: types and functions have been renamed and `getModuleFromBuffer` have an additional parameter.
